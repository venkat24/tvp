	 *
	 * This is done by calling get_mnemonic(), and string splitting it to
	 * determine the required number of bytes for each instruction.
	 *
	 * The instructions are indexed by a relative address, where the first
	 * byte is always assumed to be address 0x0000, so that this class
	 * functions independently of the real cartridge address. Note that the
	 * user of this class will need to add the start address to the relative
	 * address to get the real ROM address of any given instruction.
	 *
	 * For example:
	 *   Given a data slice that contains (hex) [01, ff, 02, 3d, 0e, 44 ...]
	 *   and input lines = 3, the lines will be parsed as
	 *
	 *   Line  Bytes            Mnemonic             Interpolated Mnemonic
	 *   1.    [01 ff 02]  =>   LD BC, (d16)    =>   "LD BC, (0xFF02)"
	 *   2.    [3d      ]  =>   DEC A           =>   "DEC A"
	 *   3.    [0e 44   ]  =>   LD C, d8        =>   "LD C, 0x44"
	 *
	 *   Final Answer
	 *   0x0001 => "LD BC, (0xFF02)"
	 *   0x0004 => "DEC A"
	 *   0x0005 => "LD C, 0x44"
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *   This is not a disassembler. The starting of the span is assumed to
	 *   be a valid instruction, the remainder of the data will be parsed with
	 *   the assumption that it is all instruction data.
	 *
	 *   If there is raw byte data in the given chunk that is NOT valid inst
	 *   data, this method WILL BREAK!
	 *
	 * @param lines Number of lines of assembly code to parse
	 * @returns A list of assembly instruction lines
